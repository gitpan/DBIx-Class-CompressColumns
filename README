NAME
    DBIx::Class::CompressColumns - Automatic Compression/Decompression of
    columns

SYNOPSIS
    In your DBIx::Class table class:

      __PACKAGE__->load_components(qw/CompressColumns ... Core/);

      __PACKAGE__->compresscolumns(
          columns   => [qw/ column_foo /],
          auto      => 1,
      );

    Note: The component needs to be loaded *before* Core.

    Alternatively you could call each method individually

      __PACKAGE__->compress_columns(qw/ column_foo /);
      __PACKAGE__->compress_auto(1);

DESCRIPTION
    This DBIx::Class component can be used to automatically compress and
    decompress data in selected columns.

METHODS
  compresscolumns
      __PACKAGE__->compresscolumns(
          columns   => [qw/ column_foo /],
          auto      => 1,
      );

    Calls "compress_columns" and "digest_auto" if the corresponding argument
    is defined.

  compress_columns
    Takes a list of columns to be compressed/decompressed during insert or
    retrieval.

      __PACKAGE__->compress_columns(qw/ column_foo /);

  _get_compressed_binary $value
    Handles the actual compression of column values into binary objects.
    When given a $value it will return the compressed binary for that value.

  _get_uncompressed_scalar $value
    Handles the actual decompression of column values into scalar strings.
    When given a $value it will return the uncompressed scalar for that
    compressed binary value.

  _compress_column_values
    Go through the columns and compress the values that need it.

    This method is called by insert and update when automatic compression is
    turned on.

  compress_auto
      __PACKAGE__->compress_auto(1);

    Turns on and off automatic compression/decompression of columns. When
    on, this feature makes all UPDATEs and INSERTs automatically insert a
    compressed binary into selected columns. SELECTS will retrieve the
    decompressed scalar from selected columns.

    The default is for compress_auto is to be on.

EXTENDED METHODS
    The following DBIx::Class::Row methods are extended by this module:-

    insert
    update

  get_column
  get_columns
